        <h1>The Silent Poet</h1>

        <p>
            Here he comes, the silent poet<br>Walking as is he was dead<br>Dragging his sorrows
            <br>No one hears him, except the silent itself<br>
        </p>
            
        <p>Here he comes, the weak poet trying to speak<br>He tries and tries, but he can't<br>
            He writes to express himself
        </p>
            
        <p>
            He tries to speak again, but again he can't<br>He gives up, until he remembers<br>
            He doesn't need to speak, because he can write<br>He leaves the town with hope in his heart, and a poem in his
            mind.
        </p>
